# A Lightweight Bytecode Interpreter

This project is a stack-based bytecode interpreter implemented in C++. It tokenizes input strings, parses them into bytecode, and executes arithmetic operations using a virtual machine approach.

## 🚀 Features

- **Tokenizer (Lexer)**: Splits input strings into meaningful tokens for parsing.
- **Parser and Bytecode Generator**: Converts tokens into executable bytecode instructions.
- **Virtual Machine**: Processes bytecode using a stack-based approach to execute operations.
- **Supported Operations**: Handles fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction.
- **Efficient Execution**: Optimized for minimal memory usage and efficient stack operations.
- **Simple Syntax**: Provides an easy-to-understand syntax for arithmetic expressions, allowing for extensibility.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++

## 📦 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gautamsingh04/A-Lightweight-Bytecode-Interpreter.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd A-Lightweight-Bytecode-Interpreter
   ```

3. **Compile the Source Code**:

   Use a C++ compiler like g++ to compile the `main.cpp` file:

   ```bash
   g++ -o interpreter main.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the Interpreter**:

   ```bash
   ./interpreter
   ```

5. **Input Arithmetic Expressions**:

   Enter arithmetic expressions when prompted. The interpreter will tokenize, parse, and execute the expressions, displaying the results.

## 💡 Example

```bash
Enter expression: 3 + 4 - 2
Result: 5
```

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Implement additional arithmetic and logical operations.
- Enhance error detection and reporting mechanisms.
- Further optimize the virtual machine for performance and memory usage.
- Support more complex expressions and extended syntax.
