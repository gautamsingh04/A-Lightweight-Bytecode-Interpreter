# A-Lightweight-Bytecode-Interpreter

• Developed a stack-based interpreter in C++ for executing arithmetic operations.
• Implemented a tokenizer (lexer) to split input strings into meaningful tokens.
• Designed a parser and bytecode generator to convert tokens into executable bytecode.
• Built a virtual machine that processes bytecode using a stack-based approach.
• Supported fundamental operations like addition, subtraction, and printing results.
• Ensured efficient execution with minimal memory usage and optimized stack operations.
• Provided a simple syntax for arithmetic expressions, allowing easy extensibility.
